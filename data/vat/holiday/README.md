We received three requests for estimates. They have received the labels "vat_holiday_n", for n in (1,2,3). The third appears to supercede the first two, but I am retaining all of them.

The first data set, vat-by-coicop.csv, includes a column called "VAT Holiday". For vat_holiday_1, anything marked 1 in that column is to carry a VAT of 0 during the holiday. For vat_holiday_2, anything with a 1 or a 2 should carry a VAT of 0.

vat_holiday_3 corresponds to the data set vat-by-coicop.ask_3.csv
