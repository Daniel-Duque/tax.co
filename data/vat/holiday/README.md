This week received three requests for estimates of the effect of a VAT holiday from senator Mar√≠a del Rosario Guerra.
They have received the labels "vat_holiday_n",
for n in (1,2,3).
The third appears to supercede the first two,
but I am retaining all of them.

The first data set, vat-by-coicop.csv,
includes a column called "VAT Holiday".
For the vat_holiday_1 strategy,
anything marked 1 in that column is to bear a VAT of 0 during the holiday.
For vat_holiday_2,
anything with a 1 or a 2 should bear a VAT of 0.

The vat_holiday_3 strategy corresponds to the data set vat-by-coicop.ask_3.csv
