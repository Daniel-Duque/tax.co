*** TODO NC2R_CE_P8 : frequency
**** it would be nice to be sure that frequency and value are orthogonal -- that is, value is the value per purchase, not the total spent on that good last week
*** what does this kind of legend mean? "8 Â» 13
*** NH_CGDUCFH_P4 : where gotten, even if not bought
**** TODO ? how to read the legend
**** restaurant, bar, cafeteria: no VAT. otherwise ignore. not quite right -- guys selling on street, for example
*** TODO NH_CGDUCFH_P6 : frequency
**** ? how to read legend. 2.1 appears in it, but 2 and not 2.1 appears in the data.
*** TODO NH_CGDU_P3 & following ? unit of measure
**** Hopefully we can ignore, but can we? 
**** Do we only need to know price, quantity and frequency?
**** Is it relevant that this is not in every data set?
