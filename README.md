# Introduction

tax.co is a model of the Colombian tax system.

Please seee [the wiki](https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/tax.co/wiki) to get acquainted.

Some metadata -- data about the datasets used -- can be found in the [freeplane](freeplane) subfolder.


# Manually downloading the data

Unfortunately this is necessary, because the OneDrive download links from Universidad Javeriana are not comprehensible to curl or wget.

The project uses the [data found here](https://livejaverianaedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/brown-j_javeriana_edu_co/Ev-W6b6TILRCk8oApROTz1YBvUQNX_HcsaAacj2xpwAIXQ). Copy the two .tgz files in the OneDrive surveys/ folder to the project's data/ folder.
