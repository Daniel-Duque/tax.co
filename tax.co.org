*** the 80% of purchases that carry 0 VAT are due to a literally 0 VAT, not a NaN VAT
*** in the 10% sample less than 0.3% of the purchases have a NaN vat rate

** TODO NEXT: match old to new file
# Plan: For each 1/100 sample file in the new, and each in the old that was used in the VAT analysis,
# create a comma-separated file (not a table) with its name, number of fields, and those fields.
# View as a spreadsheet. Sort on number of fields. Then match by hand.
** put filename-cleaned raw data on OneDrive
*** How I changed them: Change all spaces in filenames to underscores. Change files ending in .txt to end in .csv"

** code-internal
*** pdflatex: send reports to a file, not stdout
**** this way it doesn't drown the python error reports
** check data
*** TODO what are the biggest expenditures in the zero-vat set? good to check those vat rates.
*** is it half of households or half of individuals who have no income?
*** is it missing sole proprietor income?
**** is the income data equally missing in the GEIH?
** add features
*** household VAT rates by income decile
*** regional VAT rates

*** do things by estrato; assume someone's electrical estrato is their estrato
*** if we had VAT as a function of estrato, then we could
**** apply those rates to income data from a survey with more incomme data
