making 10 min wages
  before getting paid, the following is taken from that:
    4% for pension
    4% for health
    1% solidaridad
  also, his employer puts in:
    12% of that goes to pension
    8.5 salud
    5 parafiscales
    4 cajas
    something (?) for cesantias -- pretend it's 30% although it looks like 17.7

making 20, salario integral
  the employee, by law, must contribute from that:
    a few might avoid these, but surely small
    4% of 70% of that for pension
    same with salud, 4% of 70%: mandatory
      "UGPP" enforces this
    same with solidaridad: 2% (at that income level) of .7, UGPP-enforced
  employer puts in, as well:
    .12 of .7 for pension
    .085 of .7 for health
    .05 of .7 for parafiscal
    .04 of .7 for cajas
    nothing to prestaciones sociales
      = cesantias, interest on cesantias, biannual bonus ("prima de servicios")
