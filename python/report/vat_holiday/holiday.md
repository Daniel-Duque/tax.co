These figures are based on the Encuesta Nacional de Presupuestos de Hogares, which was conducted over 2016 and 2017. They imagine a 3 day VAT holiday falling in the middle of 2020. There are a number of estimates -- "no shift", "15 days", "30 days", "90 days", and "total freedom". Each estimate supposes that consumers are able to shift the timing of their purchases by a certain amount, and that they will purchase something when it is VAT-free if possible.

The two outer estimates are clearly unrealistic; the truth is certainly between them.

The estimates assume that consuemrs' ability to shift purchases is equal across income groups. For a given ability to shift, the benefits appear to accrue more to the poor because they spend a greater fraction of their income on the items in question. However, this is also unrealistic -- people with spare money, and people with looser borrowing constraints, are more easily able to time their purchases. Very roughly, households in the first three income deciles earn less than the minimum wage; we might reasonably assume that such people can only shift their purchases by 15 days, so they would save over the year about 2% of what they would have spent on VAT without the holiday (like reducing the VAT from 19% to 18.62%). Similarly, we might reasonably assume that the top decile are able to shift their purchases by 3 months, in which case they would save about 4% of what they would have spent otherwise in a year on the VAT.

Better-informed people are also more able to take advantage of the holiday. We have no way to model this.

The proposed holiday would apply only to purchases with a debit card or a credit card. This, also, we have no way to model. On the one hand, the unbanked are disproportionately poor, so this should cause the benefits to skew more toward the rich. On the other hand, 84% (I'm quoting Laura here) of Colombians have some kind of bank card, so the skew might not be so great.
