CDF / spending: draw that for every income decile

do things by estrato; assume someone's electrical estrato is their estrato

is it half of households or half of individuals who have no income?

is it missing sole proprietor income?
  is the income data equally missing in the GEIH?

if we had vat as a function of estrato, then we could
  apply those rates to income data from a survey with more incomme data

put log graphs in an appendix, put everything else linear

every spendinng graph, draw for people even with zero income
